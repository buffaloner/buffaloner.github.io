While I'm a Bills fan, I don't particularly like the use of &amp;quot;mafia&amp;quot; because of where &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wikipedia/en/A/Special:Search?title=Trenchcoat_Mafia&amp;amp;redirect=no"&gt;I perceive it entering the zeitgeist&lt;/a&gt;. I'm especially weary of it after the 5/14 massacre and the memories I had of Columbine. The perpetrators of those heinous acts were radicalized by ideologies built on othering and hate. Ideas of identity built on division. They were proud in the paleness of their complexion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've never understood hate for others simply based on how they look or who they choose to love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/mkbk_heart.png" alt="Pelican" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would say in the same vein, I'm not a fan of the word &amp;quot;pride&amp;quot; as a monicker for celebrating non-heteronormative proclivities. But there's something about the process of othering that irks me more - the shaming of an internal want that is more natural than what is considered normal. So with that in mind I wanted to provide a touch stone for what Pride is really about - not being ashamed for who you are!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's why I'm making üåàPride week my opening week for the &lt;a href="https://buffalonerbrand.com"&gt;T-Shirt store&lt;/a&gt; I've been working on. You might say this is all just &amp;quot;shameless&amp;quot; self-promotion. But isn't that the pointüòè?&lt;/p&gt;

I remember growing up when they implemented metal detectors. Kids can be cruel, and hormones reek havoc on your mind as well as your complexion. It's hard enough to pay attention to the lessons being taught when your mind wanders due to uncontrollable urges. But when you do get a moment of clarity, if you're not distracted by buzzing or waiting on the hottest gossip, you might just be able to pay attention to something longer than a ~~Vine~~ TikTok reel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now if only we could get drivers to be as studious when bikers are sharing the road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm a novice graphic designer, dabbling with Inkscape and GIMP for some simple designs as best as I can get them rendered in a high enough DPI that the prints don't look like üî•üöÆ.
